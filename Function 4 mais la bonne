4. Write a function named createIndex whose argument is vector, where vector is a column
vector containing the 100 momentum signal values. The function must return a 2-column
array variable whose rst column contains the integers 1 to 100 (in that order), and whose
second column is equal to the initial vector argument.

Function createIndex(vector() as Single) as Double
  Dim Tab() as Single
  ReDim Tab(100,2)

  For i=1 to 100
    Tab(i,1)=i
    Tab(i,2)=vector(i)
  Next i
End Function
