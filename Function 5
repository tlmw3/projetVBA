5. Write a function named assignToPF whose argument is Matrix, where Matrix is a 2-
column array variable corresponding to the output of the createIndex function, where
the second column of the output has previously been sorted by increasing momentum
signal values. Function assignToPF must return a 3-column array variable such that the
rst two columns are the same as Matrix, and the third column reports the value 1 for the
20 stocks assigned to P1, 2 for the 20 stocks assigned to P2, ..., 5 for the 20 stocks assigned
to P5.

Function assignToPF(Matrix() as Double) as Double
  
End Function
