2. Write a function named computeSignal whose argument is Ri, where Ri contains the
needed returns to compute the momentum signal for stock i as per (1). The function must
return the value of the momentum signal for stock i.

Function computeSignal( Ri() as Double ) as Double
  'Variable compteur de lignes du tableau Ri
  computeSignal=worksheet.Function(Ri)
End Function
